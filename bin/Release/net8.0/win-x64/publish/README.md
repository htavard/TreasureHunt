Just like in Minesweeper, you must uncover the tiles of a grid while avoiding mines. 

In addition to mines, there are also treasures! 
Discovering a treasure will activate a special power that varies depending on the difficulty level you choose. 

To start the game, download the zip archive and launch the executable.
